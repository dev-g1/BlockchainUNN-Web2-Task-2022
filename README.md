# BlockchainUNN-Web2-Task-2022

https://dev-g1.github.io/

This is my submission for this task.
Creating this website was not so easy at all.
However, it was interesting. Though, it was
challenging at some point, but it was fun all the way. 
I learnt new things along the way.

I would like to say thank you to BlockchainUNN
for organising this challenge. This helped me to grow
and practice some of the theory I learnt.


Pls organise more like this.
Thank you.
